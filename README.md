Employee attrition rate, also known as staff turnover or employee churn, is a metric that measures the percentage of employees who leave an organization over a specific period of time. It is a crucial indicator for businesses to assess the stability and health of their workforce. The attrition rate is typically calculated by dividing the number of employees who leave during a given period by the average number of employees during that same period, then multiplying the result by 100 to express it as a percentage.
